# TEA Model 
Zero Liquid Discharge Water Desalination Process Using Humidification-Dehumidification in a Thermally-Actuated Transport Reactor

# Project Overview
A cost-competitive solar-driven  self-contained  distributed  freshwater  production technologyusing high-salinity feed water is proposed. Under an EEREaward we will design, fabricate,and demonstrate: 
1. A 10 kg/hr zero liquid discharge (ZLD) desalination module for 100,000 ppm source water.

2. 54kWhth/m3specific  energy  consumption  (minimum  thermodynamic  limit:  19  kWh/m3)  at $1.52/m3levelized cost of water (LCOW) with specific ways to reduce the cost to $1.50/m3.

3. Acomprehensive and expandable web applicationto guide the design and energy and cost analysis of desalination processesbased on local geographic and climate conditions, and water resources

# Purpose 
To demostrate the efficiency of a solar-thermal water desalination plant. 

# Objective
To create a machine learning model using 'Penalized Linear Regression' to predic LCOW and bottom line financials subject to different geographic locations, operational parameters,and market conditions. 

# Impact
The proposed technology has the potential to upendthe desalination landscape; from its existing model of vast multibillion dollar capital projects to a low-cost distributed production business model. While the focus of the proposed technologyis on over 100,000 ppm water, a similar design can be developed for  seawater  treatment. On  top  of  being  more  energy-efficient  and  cost-effective,  a  distributed production model has downstream energy and cost saving impacts.
